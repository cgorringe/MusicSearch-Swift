## MusicSearch-Swift

By [Carl Gorringe](http://carl.gorringe.org)

An example native iOS App written in Swift that searches the iTunes API for songs by a given artist and displays them in a table view.  After selecting the song, another API is used to retrieve song lyrics.

I also created this [Objective-C version](https://github.com/cgorringe/MusicSearch-iOS) of the app.
